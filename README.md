This repository contains the code for my Master thesis project titled
*"A Study of Sequential Bias-Aware Data Assimilation Methods with Parameter Uncertainty"*,
see full text [here](https://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:d17c52da-89df-4ea5-ace3-548ef69a6c10).

This project evaluated the application of the a sequential bias-aware method, namely the
Colored-noise Kalman Filter (ColKF), to perform data assimilation (DA) in a nonlinear system
(the Lorenz-96 model) in the presence of both model bias and uncertain parameters. The
code also features a modular implementation that could be used as a starting point
for a DA library in the future.
